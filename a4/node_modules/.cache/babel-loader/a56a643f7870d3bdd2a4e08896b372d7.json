Let's explain those terms.\n\nHashing is one way because it's fast and easy to compute the hash of some data, but it's practically impossible to figure out the data that produced a given hash. Hashing produces fixed sized outputs from arbitrary sized inputs. I.e. regardless of the amount of data that goes into a hash function, the resulting hash length will always be the same.

You'll notice that changing any of the values changes the block's color - from green to red. This is how we indicate whether the block is signed.\n\nSo what is a signed block? A signed block is a valid block, one in which any transactions can be considered valid. That is, computational work has been done to verify that a block contains valid transactional data and has the hash to prove it. This signed hash, which verifies that the block is signed, is one with a certain number of leading zeros. In the interest of computational time, we've chosen to use 4 zeros as our target for determining when a block is signed.\n\nComputational time? Yes. We have to do work to find a signed block and that's where mining comes in. Mining is the work done to find a nonce which, when concatenated with the block's other fields, results in a signed block. Because of the unpredictability of the hash algorithm, there is no efficient algorithm for finding this nonce, so mining is essentially the process of guessing nonces until a signed hash is found.\nTo see this in action, change some fields in the block, turn on visualize, and click Mine!

Well, for one, this linking is what turns disparate blocks into a blockchain.
