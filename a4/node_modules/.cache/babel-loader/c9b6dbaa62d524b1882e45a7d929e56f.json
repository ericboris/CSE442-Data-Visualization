You'll notice that changing any of the values changes the block's color - from green to red. This is how we indicate whether the block is signed. \n\nSo what is a signed block? A signed block is a valid block, one in which any transactions are considered to be valid. That is, computational work has been done to verify that a block contains valid transactional data and has the hash to prove it. A block becomes signed when it's hash value is smaller than some targed value. In other words, a block is signed when it has some number of leading zeros. In the interest of computational time, we've chosen to use 4 zeros as our target for determining when a block is signed. \n\n\nComputational time? Yes. We have to do work to find a signed block and that's where mining comes in. Mining is the work done to find a nonce which, when concatenated with the block's other fields, results in a signed block. Because of the unpredictability of the hash algorithm, there is no efficient algorithm for finding this nonce, so mining is essentially the process of guessing nonces until a signed hash is found. \n\nTo see this in action, change some fields in the block, turn on visualize, and click Mine!

The current block stores and uses the previous block's hash when computing it's own hash. And that's a blockchain!\n\nBut so what? Why does referencing the previous block's hash matter? Well, for one, this linking of disparate blocks is what makes the a blockchain.

So by incorporating the previous block's hash in the computation for the following block we've connected each block in a chain.\n\nThis is important because if we wanted to manipulate the history of the blockchain we have to re-mine, not only the altered block but every block that follows which makes the blockchain tamper resistant and, in fact, more resistant to change the further back we go.
