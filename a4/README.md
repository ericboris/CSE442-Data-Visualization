This page explains how blockchains work by interleaving textual descriptions with interactive blockchain components. Explained are hashing, blocks, distributed ledgers, private/public key pairs, and signatures. Included is an interactive data-based visualization of real-world blockchains. The goal is to make blockchain technology easily understood.
